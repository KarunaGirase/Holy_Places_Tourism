        <h1>History of Vrindavan</h1>
        
        <p>Vrindavan is a historical city in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located in the Braj Bhoomi region and holds religious importance for Hindus who believe that Krishna, one of the main Gods in Hinduism, spent most of his childhood in this city. Vrindavan has about 5,500 temples dedicated to the worship of Krishna and his chief consort, Radha.It is one of the most sacred places for Vaishnava traditions.
        Vrindavan forms a part of the "Krishna pilgrimage circuit" under development by the Indian Ministry of Tourism. The circuit also includes Mathura, Barsana, Gokul, Govardhan, Kurukshetra, Dwarka and Puri
        <div id="extraText" class="hidden">
        <p>Vrindavan, deeply rooted in Hindu culture and history, emerged as a significant pilgrimage site in the 16th and 17th centuries through a treaty between Muslim and Hindu rulers. It holds immense spiritual importance, especially in connection with Lord Krishna.
        allabha Charya, a prominent saint, visited Vrindavan at the age of eleven and later undertook three barefoot pilgrimages across India, delivering Bhagavad Gita discourses at 84 sites, now revered as Pushtimarg Baithaks. He spent four months annually in Vrindavan, shaping the Pushtimarg tradition.
        The spiritual significance of Vrindavan was revived in 1515 when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu rediscovered the sacred sites linked to Krishna's life.
        Over the last 250 years, urbanization has drastically reduced Vrindavan's dense forests, threatening its wildlife, including peacocks, cows, and monkeys, and leaving only fragments of its natural beauty.

                    <div>Banke Bihari Temple, Vrindavan, is dedicated to Banke Bihari, believed to be the combined form of Radha and Krishna. Originally worshipped at Nidhivan, the idol was moved to its present temple, built around 1864.
                    The idol stands in the Tribhanga posture and was worshipped by Swami Haridas under the name Kunj Bihari, meaning "the one who enjoys in the groves of Vrindavan."
                    In the temple, Banke Bihari is worshipped as a child, so no early morning aarti or bells are allowed to avoid disturbance. Mangala aarti is performed only on Krishna Janmashtami.
                    Curtains are drawn every five minutes during darshan to prevent Banke Bihari from following devotees home, as per belief. Sharad Purnima is the only day he holds a flute, and during Shravan, he is placed in a swing.
