            <h1>History of Ayodhya</h1>
            <h2 style="color:black;">Mythology</h2>
            <p>Ayodhya, located in Uttar Pradesh, India, is one of the oldest cities with significant historical and spiritual importance. It is revered as the birthplace of Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu in Hindu mythology. Mentioned in ancient texts like the Ramayana and Atharva Veda, Ayodhya was historically known as Kosaldesa and served as the capital of the Kosala kingdom. 
    
                The city flourished during the Mauryan and Gupta dynasties and later became an important hub for Buddhism and Jainism. Emperor Ashoka is said to have built Buddhist stupas here. Jain scriptures also reference Ayodhya as the birthplace of several Tirthankaras.</p>
            <div id="extraText" class="hidden">
               <p>In medieval times, Ayodhya witnessed the rise of Hinduism under the rule of the Gahadavalas but later saw political and cultural shifts during Mughal rule. The Babri Masjid was constructed in the 16th century, which became a point of contention in later centuries.
                In modern history, Ayodhya gained global attention due to the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute over the site believed to be Lord Rama's birthplace. This culminated in the 2019 Supreme Court verdict, paving the way for the construction of the Ram Mandir, further cementing Ayodhya's status as a vital religious and cultural landmark in India.</p>

Popularly known as Bada Asthan or Badi Jagah, Dashrath Mahal houses magnificent shrines of King Ram.

                            Believed to have housed Lord Rama's childhood and King Dasharath's capital, this pretty palace hosts a decorated and ornamented entrance with beautiful paintings. Within the palace, there are saffron-clad monks chanting mantras, singing and dancing.
                            
                            Although relatively smaller than the superlative of a palace, the Dashrath Bhavan is a definite magnet during festivities such as Ram Vivah, Karthik Mela, Diwali, Ram Navami and Shravan Mela.

                            As per folklore, Kush was taking a bath in the Saryu River when his armlet fell into the water. After some time, a nag kanya (snake woman) appeared and returned it to him. They fell in love with each other and Kush got the temple structured for her.
                            
                            Being one of the most important and venerated temples in Ayodhya, it attracts large crowds of devotees from all over during the festival of Mahashivaratri. The present edifice of the temple was constructed in 1750 AD.
